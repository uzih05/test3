**Role:** You are an expert UI/UX designer specializing in creating modern, futuristic, and high-fidelity web dashboards.

**Goal:** Design a professional dashboard interface that precisely matches the aesthetic described below.

**1. Design Aesthetic & Style Definition:**
* **Style Name:** Futuristic Neon Dark Mode UI with Soft UI elements.
* **Overall Vibe:** Sleek, high-tech, clean, premium, and data-driven. It should feel immersive with depth.
* **Background:** Deep charcoal and matte black gradients. Not pure flat black. It should have a subtle texture or soft lighting vignette.
* **Lighting & Depth:** The UI cards should have soft, diffused shadows (drop shadows) that make them appear slightly elevated from the dark background. Use subtle inner glows on active elements to create a "neon" effect.

**2. Color Palette (Strict adherence required):**
* **Primary Background:** #121212 (Deep dark grey) to #000000 (Black).
* **Primary Accent (Hero Color):** Vibrant Neon Lime Green / Electric Yellow (e.g., #DFFF00 or #CCFF00). This is used for primary buttons, active states, key metrics highlights, and main progress bars.
* **Secondary Accent:** Cyan / Teal (e.g., #00FFCC) for positive growth trends or secondary indicators.
* **Typography Colors:** Pure White (#FFFFFF) for primary headings. Light Grey (#B0B0B0) for body text and labels to reduce eye strain.

**3. Typography & Shape Language:**
* **Font:** Modern, clean Sans-serif font (e.g., Inter, SF Pro Display, Roboto).
* **Corner Radius:** Heavily rounded corners on all cards, buttons, and input fields (approx. 20px - 30px radius). It should feel very soft and friendly despite the dark theme.

**4. UI Components & Visualizations:**
* **Cards/Widgets:** Modular card-based layout. Cards have dark gray backgrounds (slightly lighter than the main background) with soft borders or subtle gradients.
* **Data Viz:** Charts (bar, line, donut) must use the Neon Lime and Cyan accent colors. They should look glowing and clean.
* **Imagery:** Integrate high-quality 3D product renders (if applicable to the content) directly into the cards, making them feel part of the UI.
* **Icons:** Minimalist, thin-line icons in white or neon accent colors.

**5. Layout Structure:**
* **Navigation:** A clean sidebar navigation on the left (dark background) and a top utility bar (search, profile, notifications).
* **Grid:** A flexible grid system allowing for widgets of various sizes (small square stats, wide trend graphs, tall lists).

    3.  New Orders: 320
    4.  Conversion Rate: 3.5%
